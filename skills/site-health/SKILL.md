# site-health — fleet website measurement (routing parent)

Route by intent. Each subskill's SKILL.md is the full protocol — read the
one you need, not all of them.

| Intent | Read and follow |
|---|---|
| AI/agent readiness: llms.txt, /api/ai, index.md, robots vs AI crawlers, GEO surfaces | `skills/agent-ready/SKILL.md` |
| On-page SEO: title/meta/canonical/OG/JSON-LD/hreflang/sitemap coverage | `skills/seo-audit/SKILL.md` |
| SEO content sufficiency: article inventory, competitive intent/page gaps, comparison/alternative/use-case pages, create or publish missing pages | `skills/content-coverage/SKILL.md` |
| Performance: Core Web Vitals, Lighthouse distributions, "why is X slow" | `psi-swarm/SKILL.md` (standalone product; exposed through the skill symlink) |
| Outcome trends: SERP classes over time, "did results move", weekly run | `skills/geo-observatory/SKILL.md` |
| Ahrefs Site Audit: provider Health Score, then source fixes for crawl errors | Run `node scripts/ahrefs-site-audit-health.mjs`, then apply every **error** action from the report in the owning repo. See [Ahrefs Site Audit health](../../docs/ahrefs-site-audit.md). Do not stop at the score table. Do not deploy. Do not invent ratings. |
| Public usability: click around, guest journeys, blank/broken pages, navigation, search/detail, downloads, primary product actions | `skills/public-product-smoke/SKILL.md` |

## Combined mode — "full health check"

For "audit everything", "full health check", or "fleet health scorecard",
run the relevant subskills above and reconcile their evidence in the private
Site Health product. There is no active portfolio scorecard script in this
repository; its former implementation is retained only under
`preserved/legacy-fleet-tooling/`.

## Conventions (all subskills)

- Targets resolve via `scripts/lib/registry.mjs`.
  `../site-health/apps/backend/config/projects.json` is the canonical product
  list. Optional agent-surface metadata may enrich it but does not replace it.
- Reports land at `docs/<skill>-latest.md`.
- Evidence over vibes: cite URLs/numbers for every failing grade.
